# 🧭 Introduction to Wireframing

## 📖 What Is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic visual representation or blueprint of a digital product’s layout. It outlines the **structure**, **content placement**, and **functionality** of a webpage or application before any design elements like colors, images, or typography are added.

Wireframes focus on **usability and navigation flow**, helping designers and developers understand how users will interact with the interface.
